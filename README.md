# Modular Synths
 Here I am trying to create modular synths For a DevLog : //enter yt


I still have a lot to figure out  but you are welcome on my prototype journey
## VCO 

this design is based of  Moritz klein. with a few extras

- LEDs to visualize the output

  Needs still work as of now the offset isn't correct and the `Rl/R2` isn't set to the correct current. while testing on a bread board it looked like `10mA` is the max amperage to have a gradual scale.

  

- Maybe a triangle wave 

## Osiloscope module 

Makes it able to visualize the waves you are working with. I have seen some modules online but they are rather expensive and not in the design i like.

## DSP module 

this will be a module where you can input a audio signal and write your own filter (This can be Horrific or good sounding depending on your artistic coding) before outputting the signal again
